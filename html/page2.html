        <p>1. In the original dataset the number of people having higher probability of getting a heart disease is significantly less to that of those with lower probabiliy.<br>
        2. After oversampling the dataset now the number of people with higher and lower probability are equal.</p>

        <h3>OBSERVATIONS</h3>
        <p>1. In the original dataset the data was imbalanced significantly as we can see for both male and female there is a major difference in number of people having low and high probability.<br>
        2. After oversampling in the dataset now the number of people with higher and lower probability are almost equal.<br>
        3. Females(0) are having a higher chance of getting heart disease in Comparison to males(0).</p>

        <p>1. In the original dataset the number of high probability cases were significantly low to the lower probability cases.<br>
        2. After oversampling in the dataset now the number of higher probability cases are more than that of lower probability cases.<br>
        3. People having a higher probability of getting heart disease fall in the range 40 to 60.</p>

        2. After oversampling in the dataset now the number of higher probalility cases are for those who are taking bp medications.<br>
